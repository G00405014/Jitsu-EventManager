Project Overview
Title: Jiu-Jitsu Training and Event Management Platform (JJTEM-Platform)

Objective: To develop a Java microservices-based application that facilitates efficient management of Jiu-Jitsu training sessions, workshops, and competitive events, tailored for athletes, instructors, and event organizers.

Core Features and Microservices
User Management Microservice

Manages user profiles (athletes, instructors, organizers).
Includes registration, login, and profile editing.
Training Session Scheduler Microservice

Allows instructors to schedule and manage training sessions, workshops, or seminars.
Users can view, register for, and manage attendance.
Event Management Microservice

Handles Jiu-Jitsu competitions and event organization.
Includes event creation, participant registration, match scheduling, and result tracking.
Advanced Features (For Higher Grades)
Database Integration: Store user data, training schedules, and event details.
Front-End Interface: User-friendly interface using technologies like React or HTML/JavaScript. Responsive design for different devices.
Message Queues: For notifications about sessions, event registrations, or announcements.
Live Match Tracking: Real-time updates during events.
Technical Requirements
Containerization with Docker: Each microservice is containerized for easy deployment and scalability.
Maven: For project management and build automation.
CI/CD Pipeline: Continuous integration and deployment for testing and deployment automation.
JUnit: Writing unit and integration tests for each microservice.
Optional Technologies: Kubernetes for orchestration, React for front-end development.
Project Submission Requirements
Code Repository Access: All source code accessible via GitHub or similar platforms.
Configuration Details: Instructions for setting up and running the project.
Video Demonstration: Overview of the project, setup, features, and challenges faced.
Development Plan
Research and Planning:

Define the scope and functionalities of each microservice.
Choose the database and front-end technologies.
Microservices Development:

Develop each microservice (User Management, Training Session Scheduler, Event Management) separately, focusing on their specific functionalities.
Implement database integration for data persistence.
Integration and Testing:

Integrate the microservices and ensure they communicate effectively.
Write and execute unit and integration tests.
Front-End Development (Optional for Higher Grades):

Develop the front-end interface.
Ensure seamless integration with the backend microservices.
Containerization and CI/CD Pipeline:

Containerize the microservices using Docker.
Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
Documentation and Submission:

Prepare comprehensive documentation, including setup and usage instructions.
Record and prepare the video demonstration.
Finalize the code repository for submission.
Review and Refinement:

Conduct thorough testing of the entire platform.
Refine based on feedback or identified issues.
Timeline and Milestones
Establish a timeline with milestones corresponding to each major phase (research, development, integration, testing, documentation).
Allocate sufficient time for testing and refinement.
